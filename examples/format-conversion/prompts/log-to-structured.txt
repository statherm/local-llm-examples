Convert the following log lines into a JSON array of structured events. Each event should have these fields:
- "timestamp": ISO 8601 string
- "level": one of "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "DEBUG", "FATAL"
- "source": the component or logger name in brackets
- "message": the log message text

Respond with ONLY the JSON array, nothing else.
