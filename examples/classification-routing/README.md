# Example 02: Classification and Routing

Demonstrates small local models classifying text into predefined categories. Classification is arguably the strongest use case for small models: the output is a single label from a known set, the decision space is bounded, and latency matters because classification is often a gateway step.

## Scenarios

### Issue Triage
Classifies GitHub issues by category (bug, feature, question, docs, performance) and priority (critical, high, medium, low). 20 labeled issues covering a realistic mix.

### Intent Detection
Classifies customer support messages by intent (billing, technical, account, cancellation, feedback), sentiment (positive, neutral, negative), and whether a human agent is needed. 20 labeled messages.

## Running

```bash
# Run both scenarios with default model
go run . -model qwen3:4b

# Run a specific scenario
go run . -model qwen3:4b -scenario issues
go run . -model qwen3:4b -scenario messages

# Run with a different model
go run . -model llama3.2:3b

# Score results
go run . -score

# Generate comparison report
go run . -report
```

Or from the project root:

```bash
make run-example EXAMPLE=classification-routing MODEL=qwen3:4b
make score EXAMPLE=classification-routing
make report EXAMPLE=classification-routing
```

## Scoring

- **Issue Triage:** Accuracy per field (category, priority) and combined accuracy (both correct)
- **Intent Detection:** Accuracy per field (intent, sentiment, needs_human)

All scoring is deterministic exact match -- no LLM-as-judge.

## Expected Results

Small models (3B-4B) should achieve >90% category accuracy on issue triage and >85% intent accuracy on intent detection. The bounded output space and clear category definitions favor small models.
