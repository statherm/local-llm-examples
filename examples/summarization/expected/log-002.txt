The application experienced database connection pressure, with pool utilization reaching 95% and two requests failing with 500 errors due to exceeding the maximum connections for the database role. The connection pool self-recovered after releasing 5 idle connections, dropping utilization to 60%. Several slow queries were observed (720ms-1.2s against a 500ms threshold), suggesting the database is under load. Overall health: degraded.
