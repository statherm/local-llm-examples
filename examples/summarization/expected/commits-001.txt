## Summary
Adds WebSocket support for real-time notifications, enabling clients to receive push updates over persistent connections with JWT-based authentication.

## Key Changes
- New WebSocket upgrade handler and connection manager with ping/pong heartbeat and automatic reconnection
- Extracted notification serializer into a shared package for reuse across REST and WebSocket handlers
- Integration tests covering connection lifecycle, auth failures, message ordering, and reconnection
- API reference documentation for the new /ws/notifications endpoint

## Testing Notes
- Run integration tests for WebSocket handler: covers auth flow, message delivery, and reconnection
- Manually test WebSocket connection with an authenticated JWT token against the /ws/notifications endpoint
- Verify existing REST notification endpoint still works after serializer refactor
