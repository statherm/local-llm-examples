feat: add WebSocket support for real-time notifications

Implement WebSocket upgrade handler and connection manager.
Supports authenticated connections via JWT token in query param.

---

fix: handle connection drops gracefully

Add ping/pong heartbeat every 30s. Automatically reconnect
dropped connections with exponential backoff up to 5 minutes.

---

refactor: extract notification serializer

Move notification-to-JSON conversion into its own package
so it can be reused by both the REST API and WebSocket handler.

---

test: add integration tests for WebSocket notifications

Cover connection lifecycle, authentication failures, message
delivery ordering, and reconnection behavior.

---

docs: update API reference with WebSocket endpoint

Add /ws/notifications endpoint documentation including
authentication flow, message format, and error codes.
