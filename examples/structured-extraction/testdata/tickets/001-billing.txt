Subject: Charged twice for Pro subscription

Hi there,

My name is Marcus Johnson. I noticed that I was charged $29.99 twice on my credit card ending in 4821 for my CloudSync Pro subscription — once on Feb 1 and again on Feb 3. My account email is marcus.j@outlook.com.

I only have one account and should only be charged once per month. Can you please refund the duplicate charge? This is the second time this has happened in the last 6 months, which is pretty frustrating.

Thanks,
Marcus
