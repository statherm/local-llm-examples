Subject: Dark mode please!

Hey there! Long-time user of SketchPad Pro here (since v2.1). Love the app for wireframing. One thing that would make a huge difference for me: dark mode. I do a lot of late-night design work and the bright white canvas is rough on the eyes. I know others have asked for this too — saw a few threads on your community forum.

Not urgent at all, just wanted to add my voice. Keep up the great work!

Best,
Elena Kowalski
