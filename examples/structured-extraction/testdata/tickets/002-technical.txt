From: Priya Nair <priya.nair@techstartup.io>

We've been using DataForge Analytics for the past 4 months and the dashboard has been great. But since this morning the export-to-CSV feature just spins forever and never completes. I've tried Chrome and Firefox, cleared cache, different machine — same result. Our team needs to pull the weekly sales data for a board meeting tomorrow morning.

This is urgent. Is there a known outage? Any workaround we can use in the meantime?
