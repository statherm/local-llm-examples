Order #WH-88214

Hello, I'm Rachel Torres. I placed an order for the ErgoMax Standing Desk (walnut finish) on January 20th and was told it would arrive within 7-10 business days. It's now been three weeks and the tracking number (1Z999AA10123456784) still shows "label created" with no movement.

I paid extra for the white-glove delivery option. At this point I'd like either a delivery date or a full refund including the delivery fee. Please email me at r.torres42@gmail.com.
