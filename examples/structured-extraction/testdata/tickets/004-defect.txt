Hi support team,

I'm Tom Andersen. Bought the NovaPro Wireless Headphones (model NP-700) about 2 weeks ago from your online store. The left ear cup has started making a crackling/buzzing noise whenever bass kicks in. Tried different audio sources, different devices — it's definitely the headphone hardware.

They're still under warranty. Would like a replacement pair if possible, don't really want a refund since I like the headphones otherwise.

Tom
