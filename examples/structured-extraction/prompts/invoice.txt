{

  "invoice_number": "string — the invoice ID or number",
  "date": "string — invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": "string — item or service description",
      "quantity": "number",
      "unit_price": "number — price per unit",
      "amount": "number — line total (quantity * unit_price)"
    }
  ],
  "subtotal": "number — sum of all line item amounts before tax",
  "tax": "number — tax amount (0 if not listed)",
  "total": "number — final total including tax",
  "currency": "string — three-letter currency code (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)",

}

Rules:
- All monetary values should be numbers, not strings (e.g., 150.00 not "$150.00")
- Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- If a field is not present in the invoice, use a reasonable default (0 for numbers, empty string for text)
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
